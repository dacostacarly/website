    "text": "Statistical significance does not equal scientific importance\nIn genomics, where massive datasets often yield extremely small p-values, it’s tempting to equate statistical significance with biological relevance. But I learned that a low p-value doesn’t prove an effect is real, important, or replicable. Rather, it reflects compatibility with a statistical model under certain assumptions. This reminds me to always ask whether a result makes sense logically, not just statistically."

    "text": "The p &lt; 0.05 threshold creates harmful false dichotomies\nThe idea that 0.049 is meaningful and 0.051 is not, is especially problematic in genomics, where thousands of tests are performed simultaneously. I now see how relying on arbitrary cutoffs can lead to biased reporting, missed discoveries, and overhyped findings. In my research, I want to move beyond this binary mindset and interpret results in a more context-aware way."

This article gave me a clearer vision for the kind of researcher I want to be in graduate school."
